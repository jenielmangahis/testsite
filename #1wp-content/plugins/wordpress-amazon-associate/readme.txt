your website. The Plugin features tinyMCE editor support for searching and
inserting of amazon products and images into your content, content replacement
of static links with your associate tag, and support for inserting Amazon
Widgets through WordPress ShortCode, tinyMCE editor controls, Widget Admin,
or PHP code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I report a bug? request help? request a feature? =

If you find a bug in the WordPress Amazon Associate plugin then please let me
know by emailing it to [matt@mdbitz.com](mailto:matt@mdbitz.com) or posting the
issue in the [Support Forums](http://forums.mdbitz.com/). You can also
report it through my [trac project](http://trac.mdbitz.com/WordPressAmazonAssociate/)
using the login credential of "user" with password "guest". Another way you can
reach me is through my [website](http://labs.mdbitz.com/wordpress/wordpress-amazon-associate-plugin/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin-readme&utm_campaign=plugin)

= Do I need to configure the Amazon Web Service Keys =

No, however by not inputing a valid Amazon Web Service credential you will not be able to
insert amazon product links and images through ShortCode, the content editor's
tinyMCE control or the Quick Links Module.

= Does this plugin support Multi-Author websites? =

Yes! As of version 1.4 of the plugin we have included a Multi-User module that
if enabled allows authors to set their Amazon Associate Ids on the users profile
page. Product links in page/post content will then be tagged with the author's
associate ids, and if not set will default to the ids configured on
the *WP - Amazon * > *Settings* page.

Version 2.0 and later of the plugin enable sites administrators to define a percentage
of links where the administrator's associate id will be used instead of the author's
associate id.

= What is Link Localization? =

Link Localization is the generation of a product link that is localized to the
users version of Amazon. To give a quick example if you have your default locale
set to United States and a visitor of your website is from France then they would
be presented with a link to the amazon.fr website instead of amazon.com. This
is an optional feature that makes use of the free [ip2nation](http://ip2nation.com)
database. To make things as easy as possible the WPAA plugin includes the ability
to detect if you have ip2nation installed and if not install it for you.

= Can I choose which locales to support? =

Yes, not everyone will want to support link localization for all of Amazon's
Locales. This is why we have built in the ability to disable locales you don't
want to support. If a visitor from a disabled locale visits your website they
will be presented with a product link localized to your default locale.

= Why is Product Preview not working for my website? =

At this time there is a confirmed bug with the Amazon Product Preview code
that in some wordpress themes the previews do not occur. This error is due to
the Amazon script including it's own version of jQuery into the page causing a
conflict. To resolve the issue an optional jQuery.noConflict call to remap
jQuery is included if selected by the user on the admin screen. If product
preview still does not function for your website review your page source to see
if additional jQuery versions are loaded, if so they need to be set to
noConflict.<br>
Also at this time product preview is only supported for 1 locale at a time. We
are in the process of reviewing the code to see if this can be overwritten to
allow for product previews of all locales instead.

= My website currently uses other plugins for displaying Amazon Widgets, How can I switch to your plugin without rewriting my existing content? =

In version 1.1 we introduced a new compliance module to the plugin. This enables you to
make WPAA compliant with the ShortCode used in various other WordPress plugins for
rendering Amazon Widgets.  For the full list of compliant plugins visit
WP - Amazon > Compliance in your WordPress Admin pages. From this page you can also import
your Amazon Associate Tags/Ids from the Amazon Link and Amazon Link Localizer plugins.

= Does Wordpress Amazon Associate support I18n localization? =

Yes, we have built the plugin to support localization, and have provided a
wpaa.pot file in the languages folder of the plugin. If you have a translation
for the plugin please send the po/mo files to
[matt@mdbitz.com](mailto:matt@mdbitz.com) and I can incorporate it into the
project for other users.
